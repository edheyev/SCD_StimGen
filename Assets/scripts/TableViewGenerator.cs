    // The Mountain Scene Generator class should generate "views" comprised of multiple topographic features
    // in specific arrangements (cf. The Four Mountains Test).

    // A "view" is comprised of:
    // i) Place (unique combination of topographic features and "noise")
    // ii) Conditions: changeable lighting, weather and vegetation cues
    // iii) Viewpoint: changeable camera location

    // The same place always combines the same unique topographic features in the same locations with the same "noise".
    // A different place has a distinct arrangement of topographic features AND distinct "noise".

    // For a given target place (and view), it is possible to generate one or more comparison places (and view).
    // Comparison places have similar topographic elements to the target, but are guaranteed to be distinct in different ways:
    // i) configural foil: two features are swapped (the order around the origin is changed)
    // ii) spatial foil: one or more features is moved, while the order around the origin is preserved
    // iii) elemental foil: one or more features is replaced by a distinctive alternative.

    // Target/comparison views can be generated with the same conditions, or with different conditions.

    // Target/comparison views can be generated with a variety of viewpoints.
    // The VisibilityTester class is used to determine valid viewpoints from which all distinctive features can be seen.

    //public ConditionsController conditionscontroller; //The ConditionsController is set in the Unity Editor and includes a list of distinctive non-spatial conditions
    //(time of day, weather, vegetation colors etc.)

    //This class is accessed by updating the view list, which in turn calls the SpatialViewGenerator for much of the "heavy lifting" - populating the list with valid
    //MountainViews which contain all the information needed to render a valid mountain landscape to a terrain (done using  the TopoArray object).

    //The normal process would be to add various views to the list, and then, when ready call the topoarray build functions.
